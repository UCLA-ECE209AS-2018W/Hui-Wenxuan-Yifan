##############################################################

The repository contains two batch file that we wrote to enable automatically detect and send RF signals in Windows 10 system

auto_get.bat and get.txt need to be in the same folder

auto_get script is for detecting the signal from the car 

#############################################################

auto_send.bat and send.txt need to be in the same folder

auto_send script is for replay the signal to the car key

The two scripts will not work with the Proxmark3 SDR

Proxmark3 clients are necessary for using the SDR

The client could be downloaded at the link: https://github.com/Gator96100/ProxSpace/archive/master.zip

The two scripts need to be placed in the ProxSpace-master folder

All the codes inside Proxmark3 repository (https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3) need to be downloaded and copied into the pm3 folder
