# proxmark3:Â the official Proxmark repository!

The proxmark3 is a powerful general purpose RFID tool, the size of a deck
of cards, designed to snoop, listen and emulate everything from
**Low Frequency (125kHz)** to **High Frequency (13.56MHz)** tags.

This repository contains enough software, logic (for the FPGA), and design
documentation for the hardware that you could, at least in theory,
do something useful with a proxmark3.

## Development

The tools required to build  or run the project will vary depending on
your operating system. Please refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3/wiki) for details.

## Obtaining hardware

The Proxmark3 is available for purchase (assembled and tested) from the
following locations:

* [RyscCorp](https://proxmark3.com/) (US)
* [Hackerwarehouse](https://hackerwarehouse.com/) (US)
* [Elechouse](http://www.elechouse.com/) (HK)
* [Lab401](https://lab401.com/) (FR)
* [RFxSecure](http://www.rfxsecure.com/) (SG)
* [IceSQL](http://proxmark3.tictail.com/) (SE)
   
Most of the ultra-low-volume contract assemblers could put
something like this together with a reasonable yield. A run of around
a dozen units is probably cost-effective. The BOM includes (possibly-
outdated) component pricing, and everything is available from Digikey
and the usual distributors.

If you've never assembled a modern circuit board by hand, then this is
not a good place to start. Some of the components (e.g. the crystals)
must not be assembled with a soldering iron, and require hot air.

The schematics are included; the component values given are not
necessarily correct for all situations, but it should be possible to do
nearly anything you would want with appropriate population options.

The printed circuit board artwork is also available, as Gerbers and an
Excellon drill file.
